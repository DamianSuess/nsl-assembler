# Converted to .NET

This folder contains the 1st-pass of the nsl-assembler converted to .NET. Though it is currently not in a usable state, it provides the initial steps for building the project via dotnet.

The process was initiated via the [Java to C# Converter](https://github.com/paulirwin/JavaToCSharp) v3.0.0.

Though the conversion does show promise, the nsl-assembler project has not been truly maintained since, Apr 18, 2011.
